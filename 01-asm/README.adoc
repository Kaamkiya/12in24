= January: x86-64 Assembly

In January, I toyed with Assembly. Sepcifically, x86 64-bit Intel-flavoured
Assembly. 

Compile an Assembly program:

[source,bash]
----
nasm -f elf64 -o a.o <file>.asm # create an object file for $FILE
ld a.o                          # create an executable for the file
rm a.o                          # optional: remove the object file (it's unneeded)
----

Run the compiled program:

[source,bash]
----
./a.out # or wherever the executable compiled to
----

This is by far the most complex language in this repo, so don't start with it.
Pick something easier (literally _anything_ else in this repo).

'''

Once you've compiled the Hello World program, look at the executable. Now write
a Hello World program in literally any other compiled language. Any other
language's compiler will generate a _much_ larger executable. This is because
Assembly is the closest you can get to writing machine code. It will give tiny
executables (comparatively, at least) every time.
