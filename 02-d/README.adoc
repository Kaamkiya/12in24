= February: D

In February, I learnt https://dlang.org/[D]. I used the ``dmd`` compiler, which
you can download from the https://dlang.org/downloads.html#dmd[downloads page].

There is an alternative compiler, called ``gdc``, which is part of the GNU
Compiler Collection (GCC).

To compile a D program, run the following:

[source,bash]
----
dmd $FILE.d
----

Where ``$FILE`` is the name of the file to compile.

'''

D is a C-based language, like many others. It's syntax is quite similar, too.
If you code in C or C++, this will be quite easy for you to understand.
