= February: D

In February, I learnt https://dlang.org/[D]. I used the ``dmd`` compiler, which
you can download from the https://dlang.org/downloads.html#dmd[downloads page].

There is an alternative compiler, called ``gdc``, which is part of the GNU
Compiler Collection (GCC).

To compile a D program, run the following:

[source,bash]
----
dmd $FILE.d
----

Where ``$FILE`` is the name of the file to compile.

'''

D is a C-based language, like many others. It's syntax is quite similar, too.
If you code in C or C++, this will be quite easy for you to understand.

'''

The ``hello-dub`` directory was made using the ``dub`` command, which comes
packaged with ``dmd``, but not ``gdc``. For this reason, I recommend ``dmd``,
although ``gdc`` compiles faster. It really depends on your needs; are you
making a package that you want to make part of dub? Or are you just making some
quick scripts?
