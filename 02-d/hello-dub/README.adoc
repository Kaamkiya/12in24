= Hello, Dub!

This is an example ``dub`` project. Dub is D's package manager, and it's used
to make libraries and when you have dependencies. 

Run the following command to make a new dub project:

[source,bash]
----
dub init $PROJECT_NAME
----

Replace ``$PROJECT_NAME`` with the name of your project. Dub will then give you
some prompts. Fill them out as you like, and then see inside of your brand-new
``dub`` project. 

Some more ``dub`` commands:

[source,bash]
----
dub run   # run the project
dub build # build the project
----
